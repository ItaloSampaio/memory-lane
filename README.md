# üìù  Overview
Memory Lane is a web application designed to allow users to create, store, and share their cherished memories with friends and family. Users can organize these memories in a "Memory Lane," a chronological collection of events with titles, descriptions, timestamps, and images. The application addresses the common user pain point of managing memories across multiple platforms by providing a single, seamless solution.

# üåü Features
- **Create Memory Lanes**: Organize memories chronologically with titles, descriptions, timestamps, and images.
- **Shareable Links**: Easily share Memory Lanes with others via a unique URL.
- **User-Friendly UI**: A responsive and visually appealing interface built with React and Tailwind CSS. It is optimized for desktop use as the mobile responsiveness is still in progress.
- **Image Uploads**: Drag-and-drop functionality for uploading images to events.
- **Custom Design System**: The app comes with its own design system to ensure a consistent and cohesive user experience across all components and pages.
- **Anonymous User Creation**: Users are automatically signed in as anonymous users by default, with no need to create an account or log in.
- **UUIDv7 for Unique Identifiers**: The app uses *UUIDv7 to generate unique identifiers to ensure that each entity has a globally unique ID, which can be timestamped and sorted chronologically.
